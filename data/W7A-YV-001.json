    "track_notes": "Someone with a high ground clearance 4WD vehicle like a Jeep might drive to the summit as one of the Prescott activators told me he did. However, I chose to park my 4WD high ground clearance F-250 at a pull off and hike the steep rocky road the rest of the way to the summit. Driving to the parking spot is a bit of an adventure. From the intersection of Gurley St and Mt Vernon Ave in Prescott, go south on Mt Vernon Ave which turns into Senator Hwy. The road goes from paved to gravel to one-lane during a 12 mile drive to a turnoff to the right at GPS 34.413939,-112.434051. Another turnoff to the right onto Golden Eagle Rd occurs a short time later at GPS 34.411488,-112.43887, followed by another right turn at GPS 34.412091,-112.448133. I parked on a slight rise off the side of the road at GPS 34.418683,-112.44755 and hiked the remaining 0.3 mile to the summit. There are trees from which to hang antennas and a fairly large activation zone. Combine this with Mt Union and Spruce Mtn.",
